# Sample Code for Welcome

Hey team, 

Here are some examples of PHP & JS I've recently written for my wife's non-profit. 

`page-home.php` shows using reusable components which can be found in the `/components` folder. 

`countDownToJoin.js` shows the js used to determine if visitors to the "page-monthly_gatherings.php" page are alowed to join the zoom meeting or not and display a countdown clock.
